/**
 * An instance of <code>PubSection</code> represents a section in 
 * a publication. Here, the term "section" is used for all hierarchical levels 
 * within a publication. For example, a <code>PubSection</code> node could be  
 * rendered either as a book-part, chapter, preface, appendix or any other kind
 * of section within a publication, depending on the publication settings and 
 * the depth of the node relative to the root node of the publication.
 *
 * <p>A <code>PubSection</code> node can contain all types of child 
 * nodes. However, only child nodes of type <code>PubSection</code> and 
 * {@link PubContent}, as well as {@link Reference} nodes to one of  
 * these node types, appear in an exported publication. 
 * For example, if a <code>PubSection</code> node, that contains a child node 
 * of type <code>Folder</code>, which itself contains child nodes of type 
 * <code>ImageFile</code>, is exported as part of a publication, then the 
 * image files in the folder do not appear in the exported publication, unless 
 * an image is referenced from within an exported <code>PubContent</code> node.
 * </p>
