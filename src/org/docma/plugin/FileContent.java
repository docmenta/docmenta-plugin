/**
 * The <code>FileContent</code> interface represents content that has a
 * user-defined filename and format.
 * Generally, <code>FileContent</code> nodes can be used to store files of 
 * any format that have been created with external applications. 
 * For example, this can be plain text files or binary files, like multimedia 
 * files.
 *
 * <p><em>Image files:</em> 
 * For supported image formats, the sub-interface {@link ImageFile} exists.
 * This sub-interface changes the filename handling and adds further 
 * functionality. 
 * A file has a supported image format, if its filename ends with one of the 
 * extensions returned by
 * <code>PluginUtil.getImageFileExtensions()</code>).
 * See the documentation of <code>ImageFile</code> for further information.</p>

     * {@link #getFileExtension()} method.

     * original filename, where <i>XX</i> is the language code of the  
     * translation language (in upper-case letters).
     * In other words, if the session is in translation-mode, and translated 
     * content exists for the current translation language, then the returned
     * filename has one of the following formats, depending on whether a file 
     * extension is assigned or not:</p>
